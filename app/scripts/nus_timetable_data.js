The adviser and student will select a topic for investigation within the advisers area of expertise. For example, the assignment might require the students to read some recent journal articles or chapters in selected books. During subsequent meetings, the student and adviser will discuss the material and related issues. The student will then prepare a brief written report summarizing the background and significance of the problem under consideration, the approaches used to solve the problem, and the results of the investigations reported in the articles or books. The written report is due at the end of the semester.

It is offered as part of the CP3101 Topics in Computing series. Student teams will be associated with a select group of open source software projects. These projects are characterized by being active in both development and utilization as well as being open to new and relatively inexperienced committers. They are also projects that are deemed to be relevant in today's software ecosystem. We also believe there is value in seeding awareness of how to contribute to open source projects like these among future technology leaders. Ideally there will also be some value from the development work student teams contribute back to the project as well.",

Increased accountability also requires Managers to rely less on their intuition and more on “System 2 thinking” i.e. facts and scientifically-tested methods to gain insights in complex business problems and thereby substantiate the decision-making process. Many managerial decisions, regardless of the functional orientation, are increasingly being based on analysis using quantitative models and tools such as Decision Analysis, Simulation Modelling and Mathematical Optimization. The use of these business analytics for modelling and decisions represents the future of best practices for tomorrow’s success companies.",

In the process of developing these tools, we will discuss the determinants of consumption and investment. Next we turn to different business cycle theories. Specifically, we study the Keynesian, New Keynesian, Neo Classical and Real Business Cycle models, and examine their different assumptions and policy prescriptions for macroeconomic stabilization. IS-LM and AD-AS frameworks are employed in studying some or all of these paradigms. Finally, we evaluate the predictions of these models against business cycle facts. We will also briefly review national income accounting and discuss some measurement issues.",

This is followed by an initiation into the concepts of classical probability, paving the way for the important topics of random variables and probability distributions. Next, the core ideas of classical statistical inference are introduced - including sampling distributions, point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing and analysis of variance. Finally, correlation and regression analyses will be covered.",

It is designed to equip students with the standard tools and techniques to analyze microeconomic issues and to prepare them to access higher level modules that utilize microeconomic analysis. The module begins with a review of several foundation topics on consumer and producer theory covered in the prerequisite course, i.e. EC2101. It then moves on to discuss the general equilibrium model, whereby consumers and producers are put together in a general equilibrium framework. After that, it covers choice over time, i.e. inter-temporal choice and choices over different states of the world, i.e. choices under uncertainty. It then continues with game theory. This topic will be discussed extensively. Coverage will include various solution concepts for one-shot games and sequential move games. Applications of the theory on the issues of oligopolistic competition, entry and entry prevention, and network economics will receive a great deal of attention. Finally, the module ends with the asymmetric information, i.e. moral hazard and adverse selection and its application on the internal organisation of the firm. Throughout the course, empirical observations and real-life cases pertaining to the issues discussed in this module are presented.",

We next examine the expectations-augmented Phillips Curve, and simple inflation-unemployment dynamics. We also study further policy issues (time inconsistency, Ricardian Equivalence, profit-sharing), open-economy macroeconomics (the Mundell-Fleming model), and simple growth theory (the Solow model and the AK endogenous growth model).",

			"description": "The module addresses issues of historical trauma and cultural memory; through a focus on how such memory is manifested in aesthetic (primarily literary) representation. The module assumes a dual approach to the study of selected texts, requiring attention to the topic of violence and memory on the one hand; and the ethics and politics of representation on the other. Literary texts will illuminate problems of narrative agency, responsibility and testimony in the aftermath of a violent past. The conceptual framework of discussions derive from Maurice Blanchot and his influence on post-structuralism, and from contemporary uses of psychoanalysis by literary theorists.",

Through the study of key literary texts, the evolution of ideas about nature will be traced from the 17th century's age of scientific discovery to the 21st century's idea of environmental crisis. A key element of the model will be the use of ecocritical ideas and concepts as a way to approach and understand connections between literature and the environment.",

			"description": "This interdisciplinary module will acquaint students with various theoretical approaches to the moving image, and equip them to write critically about contemporary screen cultures of Southeast Asia. Readings will be from media theory, art history and critical theory, as much as film studies. The module encourages students to think beyond the conventions of cinema studies (national cinema, genre, etc), the rationale being that as screen culture spreads beyond industrial cinema, so too should theory and criticism. Films studied will privilege independent and experimental work, video/media art, animation and web-based video, emphasising the diversification of moving image practices with video and digital media.",

			"description": "This module will first introduce students to Environmental Law, particularly conservation and pollution laws, and how these are passed and implemented at the international, regional (ASEAN) and national (Singapore) levels. It will emphasise that laws alone will not help in ensuring the quality of a country’s environment and the health of its citizens. Laws must be enforced, and the rule of law respected. Good governance is therefore a necessary component of sound environmental management. This module will next examine what constitutes good environmental governance. It will explore environmental and economic policies and how best to resolve the tensions between conservation and development. It will study the setting up of effective administrative institutions, land use planning, the provision of environmental infrastructure (modern sanitation, water treatment plants, transport systems, etc). It will then critically examine the workings of the main administrative agencies that are responsible for environmental management in Singapore. It will also look into the work of local and international non-governmental organisations (NGOs) as well as multi-national corporations and corporate social responsibility in Singapore. Comparisons will be made with the administrative and legal systems in other jurisdictions. This module will be taught by staff members from the Law Faculty as well as the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.",

In this course, you will examine concepts such as role and identity, speaker credibility, talk and gestures, and audience perception. You will explore the innateness and invention of specific speech traits and behaviours—with a focus on how a public persona is strengthened or attenuated, and shaped—by analyzing various performances (i.e., interview, roundtable discussion, public talk, and the US presidential debate 2012). The course assignments are expected to demonstrate your understanding of these human communication concepts and specific applications of your analysis outcomes in constructing a credible public persona in presentations.",

But they often draw upon official documents that are sometimes bland statements of fact, eyewitness accounts that vary greatly, or the seemingly hidden world of text and social media. We will cast a critical eye over this process of building essays reports or memos with facts and interviews and discuss how some of the best writers in the business get it right, or not.",

Examples are plentiful, such as \"Molecular Biology\", \"Molecular Genetics\", \"Molecular Electronics\", \"Molecular Medicine\", \"Molecular Informatics\", \"Molecular Engineering\", \"Molecular Pharmacology\", \"Molecular Ecology\", \"Molecular Machines\"... etc. In the \"Science of Molecules\" viz. \"Chemistry\", the focus is on molecular design, molecular structure, molecular synthesis, molecular activity and molecular function. The function depends on the activity, which in turn is governed by the design and structure. Chemical synthesis is generally guided by good structural design. Molecular structures therefore are the fundamentals in molecular science. In this seminar series, we shall discuss with the class the underlying principles of chemical structures, with specific focus on the interrelationship among the five S's of molecules -Science, Structure, Stability, Symmetry, and, Space. The mode of teaching and learning focuses on group learning, interaction, independent enquiry, project work, molecular models, and public presentations. Writing and presentations are essential elements in this freshmen seminar. There will also be hands-on sessions on molecular models and molecular origami.

Is probability intuitive? A class exercise will be conducted where students are asked to generate sequences of real and fake random coin tosses and are asked to develop tests to detect the difference. 2. What is the role of randomization in the design of scientific experiments (for instance, why are patients randomly assigned to treatments in a medical trial)? We recreate a famous incident in which a tea time conversation led to a statistician conducting an experiment to test whether someone could distinguish whether milk had been added first or last to a cup of tea. 3. How has statistical thinking been used and abused in the history of IQ testing? 4. In the analysis of environmental problems like global warming scientific models are often used which are deterministic (roughly speaking, such models predict a definite output for a given input). A statistical model on the other hand gives predictions in the form of probabilities of different possible outcomes. How can the deep physical understanding embedded in the deterministic models be reconciled with statistical approaches to quantifying uncertainty and risk, and why is quantifying uncertainty important? 5. How can fake random numbers generated on a computer by non-random rules sometimes do complicated calculations that aren’t easily done by other means? 6. Why is statistical thinking so crucial in modern scientific enquiries in which massive databases of mostly uninteresting information are being searched for interesting features (in astronomy, genetics and market research for example)?",

			"description": "The development of mathematical concepts and theories is often influenced by an intuition acquired from physical experience and by analogy with various areas of scientific and mathematical knowledge. Analogy is an important factor in preparing, if not predicting, new concepts while an experience-based intuition can sometimes be an obstacle. The objective of this seminar module is to present case studies of the creative role of analogy in mathematics and of the ground-breaking importance of \"counter-intuition\" in modern mathematics. A wealth of examples of both can be found in geometry, number theory, analysis, algebra, logic, set theory and theoretical computer science. Students of this module are expected to source for relevant material in books, journals and the internet under the guidance of the lecturer. The emphasis, however, will be on the spirit of the mathematical enterprise rather than on the technical mastery. To illustrate the use of analogy and intuition in problem solving, some elementary problems and puzzles will be posed in class for attempt and discussion.

Structures and electronic and magnetic structures behave differently when their dimensions are reduced to the range of between one and a few hundred nanometres (1 nanometre = 10-9 metre). They exhibit novel and much-improved mechanical, electrical, optical, chemical and biological properties, due entirely to their nanoscopic size. The nanoworld is therefore an exciting new realm that brings together the traditional disciplines of physics, chemistry, materials science, biology and engineering. To understand the nanoworld, we will introduce basic and advance spectroscopy and scattering synchrotron-based techniques such as x-ray absorption, x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, resonant soft x-ray scattering, xray photoemission spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy, angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction. We will also introduce scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The aim of this module is to familiarise students with the main issues and techniques relevant to the nanometre scale. Questions that will be addressed include: What is the significance of the nanoscale? What measurement techniques allow us to examine such systems? How can we fabricate objects and devices on the nanometre scale? What are the examples of fascinating nanosystems? How will nanodevices and nanomaterials change our lives in the future?

			"description": "Nanoparticles may be defined as colloids about 1-100 nanometers in size and are considered a cornerstone of the emerging discipline of nanoscience and nanotechnology. At such small length scales, nanoparticles often exhibit unusual properties that differ from their bulk counterparts. For example, a semiconductor nanoparticle of the same material can emit all colors of the rainbow as its size is varied from 1 to 7 nanometers in diameter while nanoparticles of gold no longer glitter but look red under room light. These properties are only beginning to be exploited for use in the medical, electronic and chemical industry and will undoubtedly have a great impact on next-generation technologies. Through this seminar module, students will be introduced to different nanoparticles and their physicochemical properties from a chemist’s perspective. They will also be introduced to the latest discoveries in nanoparticle research that are being translated rapidly into commercially available technologies.",

			"description": "There are literally thousands of chemical reactions in the field of organic chemistry, but only a handful of them are most relevant to non-chemists (e.g. life scientists). The term bioorthogonal chemistry refers to some of these chemical reactions that can occur inside living systems without interfering with native biochemical processes. Since its introduction, the concept of the bioorthogonal reaction has enabled the study of many types of biomolecules under native cellular environments. In recent years, it has been expanded to many other fields, materials, nanotechnology and engineering. This seminar is intended for junior undergraduates who are interested in equipping themselves with a few very basic but essential set of organic reactions which are most relevant to non-specialists. The module will be conducted in the form of seminar discussion and presentations in a highly interactive manner. Both students and the professor will learn hand-in-hand about the subject of interest, and the students will be required to participate actively in twoway discussion. By using key examples in bioorthogonal chemistry developed in the last decade, the students will focus on interactive learning in unconventional ways (reading, literature search, group discussion, independent studies, presentation, etc). The professor will mostly serve as the facilitator (not feeder) of the learning process.",

Students following the module can expect to be tutored in a number of techniques that may include (depending upon expertise of staff who are available to teach the module) geomorphic hazard mapping, micro-meteorology, palaeoecology and remote sensing. The module goes on to discuss the implications to humans of past and present environmental dynamism and of predicted environmental changes. Among the topics for student-led discussions in this part of the module are the dialectic of global climate change; the contribution of urban areas to global climate change; possible relationships between biodiversity and environmental instability; and inequalities in the degree of human vulnerability. A seminar presentation focusing on the relevance of the module to their thesis or on thesis topic is expected.",

			"description": "The essence of nanoscience and technology is the ability to understand and manipulate matter at the molecular level. Structures behave differently when their dimensions are reduced to the range of between one and a few hundred nanometres (1 nanometre = 10-9 metre). Such structures exhibit novel and much-improved mechanical, electrical, optical, chemical and biological properties, due entirely to their nanoscopic size. The nanoworld is therefore an exciting new realm that brings together the traditional disciplines of physics, chemistry, materials science, biology and engineering. The aim of this module is to familiarise students with the main issues and techniques relevant to the nanometre scale. Questions that will be addressed include: What is the significance of the nanoscale? What measurement techniques allow us to examine such systems? How can we fabricate objects and devices on the nanometre scale? What are the examples of fascinating nanosystems? How will nanodevices and nanomaterials change our lives in the future? This module is targeted at students from different faculties who are interested in learning some general knowledge of nanoscience and nanotechnology.",

			"description": "Environmental protection is now fundamental to the development of a sustainable global society. No longer is human influence on the planet confined to the local environment, but now extends across political boundaries - often resulting in regional or even global impacts. As a result, society, industry and agriculture are under increasing pressure to improve environmental performance and cut resource consumption and pollution. Around the world, governments are striving to minimise waste production, protect water resources, reduce energy consumption and improve the quality of the urban living environment. As the human global population grows exponentially and the life-support systems of the planet continue to deteriorate, there is a growing international recognition that environmental problems require truly global solutions. This course will focus on the issues and causes of global environmental issues including: population growth, resource exploitation and threats to the atmosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere. The aim of the course will be to provide students with a knowledge and appreciation of the inter-related problems and challenges of sustainable development.",

This has had a profound effect on how our species have progressed and will continue to influence how our future is shaped. The recent distastrous effects of tsunamis and hurricanes, coupled with concerns about global warming, climate change and carbon recycling have made it important to understand more about how the oceans work on a global scale. This course will introduce students to: (1) Various phenomena/features related to the oceans, such as tsunamis, thermohalines, tides, currents, storms, marine life and bioluminescence etc.. (2) How the oceans affect our lives (e.g. weather, climate, sources of food, travel etc) , (3) Our attempts at understanding the workings of the oceans using exploration and the scientific theories that have been developed over the last few decades. (4) Our attempts at controlling and exploiting the oceans (e.g. conservation, energy, marine engineering). Students will gain an appreciation of the scientific principles involved with the minimum of mathematics. This course will also prepare studnets to better understand the role of oceans, and provide insight into making educated decisions regarding our vulnerable environment and our precious supply of water.",

It begins with a meditation on the phrase “seeing is believing”; and questions the privileging of sight over all the other senses. Through a close reading of various texts, seminar participants will explore the relationality between sight and blindness—are they necessarily antonyms, or are they always already a part of each other? And if they are intimately related, what are the implications on knowledge? Are we all potentially blind to our own insights?",

The student should approach a College Fellow to work out an agreed topic, readings, and assignments for the module. Part of this conversation should be to specify in what sense the topic and/or approach are interdisciplinary, multi-disciplinary or trans-disciplinary in character. A formal ISM contract is to be submitted to the Director of Studies for approval. Evaluation is based on 100% Continuous Assessment and must be worked out between the student and the supervisor prior to seeking the College’s approval.

The module looks at both decolonisation and nation-building as processes characterised by debate and contestation in relation to (a) social, regional and group identity and (b) political rights and power. The module will study the impact of that debate and contestation on the character, institutions and political life of the nation.",

Indeed, the new China has been premised upon revolutionary remaking and a total break from the past. Nonetheless, there are still historical continuities when compared with the previous imperial and republican eras. This module aims to provide a deeper understanding of contemporary China by looking at its politics, society, economy and culture in broad historical perspective and within a thematic framework. It also explores China’s distancing and connecting with the rest of the world.",

			"description": "Process Analysis and Redesign is a systematic approach to helping an organization analyze and improve its processes. In this course the term ‘redesign’ includes ‘reengineering’. All systems are designed and developed to support business processes. Therefore, an understanding of the business processes is crucial to choosing how to build and manage systems, re-skill personnel and retool the infrastructure. A business process is a collection of activities that creates an output that is of value to some customer. Business processes can be improved at any level of an organization or can be improved across multiple organizations. Typically, Business Process Redesign/Reengineering (BPR) uses information technology to enable business process change in order to reduce costs, improve service, and reduce cycle times. Several BPR methodologies exist. Most methodologies require the construction of an “As-Is” and “To-Be” model. This course will discuss the role of BPR in managing technology and the operational functions. The course will cover the strategic, operational and technological dimensions of BPR in the context of quality improvement, Information Technology and business operations. Case studies will provide real-world context for the concepts discussed in class. The course is designed to teach students BPR methodologies and modeling techniques that accompany the methodology. Students will identify an organization (or part of an organization) that needs improvement. Next, they will analyze the current system, investigate possible Information Technology and operational solutions, redesign the current system and propose a plan to move from the “As-Is” system to the “To-Be” system.",

Many observers have pointed to Hollywood’s decline in recent decades. Meanwhile, Asian cinemas are on the rise, offering local moviegoers alternatives to the Hollywood blockbusters that have dominated theaters across the globe for decades. Hollywood has become an export-driven industry, and Asia provides its most important overseas market. In this small seminar, students will discuss topics such as the most recent kung fu movie craze, Hollywood remakes of Asian films, and cross-cultural fandom. We'll analyze films such as Infernal Affairs, Slumdog Millionaire, and Rush Hour 2. Studying both popular media coverage and academic essays, students will learn how authors construct arguments around a particular topic, how these discourses respond to one another, and how they themselves can construct their own responses to a topic.",

The course will start with an appreciation of the immense biodiversity of plants in our region. The irreplaceable values that natural primary forests have will be emphasized. The case of the need to extend these forests by recreating them in the urban context will be discussed. The appropriate use of non-indigenous plants will also be covered. The need to be ecological-minded when selecting plants will be emphasized with particular attention being placed on conservation; the beautification of place should not be done at the expense of making another landscape look less attractive. Lectures will be augmented with field trips which serve illustrate the application of the principles discussed to the ground. The business implications to matching the right plant to site, using quality plants and then being able to care for them professionally will be covered.",

Students are also trained to learn basic self-study skills in Japanese to enable them to continue studying Japanese both in and outside of the classroom.",

This module hopes to offer students clues to what are the fundamental ways in which basic biological structures and functions of living systems are actively modified to allow organisms to exploit the full range of natural environments and to maintain the radically different modes of life we see in nature. Efforts will be made to teach how environmental physiology can be applied to biomedicine, agriculture, ecology and environmental conservation in the last part of the module.",

			"description": "Effective marketing research is necessary for successful management of all phases of the marketing process, ranging from product development and introduction to selling through growth and maturity stages. In today's information-oriented environment, a marketing manager cannot succeed without a thorough understanding of the research process. By understanding the research process, he can better judge the suitability, reliability and the validity of a research study in his decision-makings. Students will learn by doing in this course. While we will use class time to discuss appropriate research topics, students are required to do lots of activities by themselves in order to facilitate their learning by doing. In doing so, this course incorporates an experimental element in marketing research and consulting. As a marketing information provider, students will be assisting a firm by collecting and interpreting market data as a means toward the development of a superior marketing plan. At the same time, students will conduct tutorial activities that will provide opportunities for students to practice the key topics covered in the class. This course is intended to acquaint students with the fundamental marketing research process. More specifically, this course aims: (i) To familiarise the student with the fundamental marketing research skills of problem formulation, research design, questionnaire design, data collection, data analysis, and report presentation and writing. (ii) To have the student gain perspective and practice in applying these skills through a research project. (iii) To develop an understanding of decision making in marketing, its inherent difficulties and pitfalls and the importance of information in marketing research.",

Organisational behavior is a field that draws ideas from psychology, social psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science, and management and applies them to the organisation. The field of organisational behaviour covers a wide range of topics: organisational culture, motivation, decision making, communication, work stress and so on. In the end, the field of organisational behavior asks two questions: (1) why do people behave as they do within organisations? (2) how can we use this information to improve the effectiveness of the organisation?",

			"description": "This module introduces fundamental concepts of physics and is illustrated with many practical examples. Topics covered include a) Electricity and magnetism, where the basic concepts of electric and magnetic fields, forces on charged particles, electric potential, electromotive force, work and energy, are described. The properties of basic electrical circuits comprising resistors, inductors and capacitors are discussed, along with analysis of their transient and steady-state behaviour. Understanding the role of Maxwell's equations in electromagnetism is emphasized; b) Waves, introducing properties of waves, including geometric optics, propagation, interference and diffraction, and electromagnetic waves; and c) Quantum physics, where new physics concepts which led to the quantization of energy are introduced, leading to an explanation of atomic transitions, atomic spectra and the physical and the chemical properties of the atom. The uncertainty principle, wave-mechanics and wave particle duality concepts are covered, together with the use of wavefunctions in predicting the behaviour of trapped particles. The module is targeted essentially at Engineering students.",

After a discussion of the various versions of Bernoulli's equation and the concept of vorticity, the study of fluid flows starts with the potential flows, with an application to the theory of airfoils. The theory of irrotational water waves is then presented to illustrate dispersive wave propagation and the hyperbolic tendency to form shocks. The balance of these two tendencies produces soliton solutions. The concept of flow similarity is applied to the study of boundary layer. The phenomenon of boundary layer separation is discussed. The concept of hydrodynamic instability is illustrated with the Rayleigh-Benard convection problem. The chaotic dynamics of the related Lorenz equation is then presented. A brief introduction to turbulence closes the module.",

To help us decide which answer is correct, we shall examine various important positions on the nature of consciousness including physicalism, dualism, eliminativism, and idealism.",

The course will focus on key questions asked about the brain, such as: How is the brain organised? How do drugs affect our behaviour? How does the brain see, hear and produce movement? How does it learn and think? Clinical topics, such as Parkinson's Disease and schizophrenia will be integrated into the course, as will fMRI research methods and findings. Emphasis will be given to the key principles of nervous system function, however, the course still requires a lot of factual information to be assimilated and memorized.",

Especially several South-Indian dynasties (as, e.g. the Pallavas and the Cholas), under which trade and the setting up of diplomatic ties flourished, were the main responsible forces for an early spread of Indian cultural and social concepts and values beyond South Asia – and especially to Southeast Asia. The module aims at looking at those early forms of contact between the two regions, and at providing an understanding of the concepts of “kingship”, society, religion and culture, that became shared as a consequence. We will explore how much about “everyday life” in old times can be learned from inscriptions, and how temple-constructions and other pieces of Art can give insights into these concepts. We will also look into early trade-connections between South India and Southeast Asia (trading guilds) and into the impact of cultural influence – especially of the Chola dynasty – in the region.",

Yet, as we all know, the evolution of Singapore, from classical regional emporium to international port city and strategic naval base, has all along been defined by much larger regional and international forces. After its emergence as a sovereign state in 1965, Singapore continues to project itself as a 'global city-state'. Our local society has an 'international' make-up, being the product as it were of historical and current diasporic trends. This module provides an international framework for a study of the history of Singapore, and seeks to examine the historical evolution of Singapore against the contexts of regional and international changes and developments from the 14th to the 20th century.

In particular it will examine bilateral collaboration in infrastructure development (ports and telecommunications) and services (airline and tourism) industries to explain the success and problems of bilateral economic collaboration. The target audiences are students from various Faculties who would like to have a better understanding of Singapore's evolving foreign economic policy in South Asia in an increasingly globalised economy.",

			"description": "The Capstone Experience is open to undergraduate members of the College (Year 2 and above) and builds on the first and second year modules of the UTown Residential Programme. Students may elect to work individually (e.g. as part of an internship) or in an multidisciplinary group. Together with an external organization, and under the guidance of an academic supervisor, they apply disciplinary knowledge and skills to address an issue or question which is authentic and of practical relevance to the community. In the process, students engage communities and organizations either locally or abroad in planning, implementing and communicating their ideas and concepts, develop collaborative and leadership skills, cultural competency and an awareness of civic values. The learning experience is reflected in well-researched and thoughtful situational analyses, a learning journal, and midterm and final reports or presentations. Capstone experiences will be supervised by College faculty with expertise in the chosen area, with the participation of a qualified preceptor from the external organization.",

Through the practical sessions, students will experience hands-on the various aspects of a stage production, from acting, directing to design and stage management.",

The module will revisit many of these objections and reveal that they are based on reasoning that is incompatible with the principles of science. We will investigate, why it is \"Neo-Darwinism\" and not \"Intelligent Design\" that is currently the best supported paradigm for explaining \"adaptation.\" We will then challenge the power of the neo-Darwinian paradigm by asking how seemingly incompatible phenomena like altruism and excessive male ornamentation can possibly be explained by natural selection. We will also study several key events in evolution such as the origin of sex and its numerous consequences and the origin of the human species. We will conclude with discussing the importance of the theory of evolution for understanding cultural evolution (\"memes\") and human health and senescence (\"Darwinian medicine\").",

This course will introduce you to the recently developed field of biosemiotics the interdisciplinary study of sign processes as they occur variously across the biological spectrum. Looking at the close relation between living systems and their sign systems (hence the term: bio-semiotics), this still-emerging discipline seeks to traces the evolutionary development of sign-mediated ways of being in the world from its beginnings in the transmission of information across single cells to its most complicated realisation in the abstract forms of human thought.",

Irony presupposes disjunctions – between what is said and what is meant, what is perceived and what is real. It thus involves a critical attitude in exploiting and/or perceiving disjunctions. It is often directed with negative effect towards figures and structures of authority, and is sometimes an integral part of a world-view. Students will engage closely with a variety of texts of different types, including poems, tracts, short stories, speeches, plays, sketches, songs and pictures. In doing so, they will reach a better understanding of the roles irony can play not only in literature, but also in society more generally. Since the texts are drawn from different historical times, media and geographical locations, students will get a sense of the widespread use of irony in culture and society.",

Facilitated by the instructors, students will engage in discussions in small groups. The focus of these discussions need not be on the content of the talks per se, but on the process of intellectual inquiry; and the aim is not to find answers per se, but to ask (good and feasible) questions.

# NUSMods Scrapers

The NUSMods scrapers consolidates and normalizes information from various
official sources and provides the raw data that is displayed on the NUSMods
website.

## Supported universities

This scrapers folder is set up to support multiple scrapers for multiple
universities. However, we have only implemented an NUS scraper. More details on how each scraper works
can be found in its folder.

1. [NUS Scraper](nus-v2)

If you are from another university and would like to implement a scraper for
your uni, feel free to file an issue or just contact us! We already have some
partially implemented scrapers for SMU [in an older
repo](https://github.com/nusmodifications/nusmods-api/tree/smu) but we don't
have the time to work on them.

## Contributing

Suggestions are very welcome, and if you have any particular needs for your
app, feel free to open an issue or pull request, or simply contact us directly.
We'd be happy to deploy any additional tasks to the live scraper server as
well.

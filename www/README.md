## Contributing

Don't know where to start? First, read our repository [contribution guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md). Next, we highly recommend reading [this fantastic beginner's guide][zames-guide] written by one of our contributors. Alternatively, have a poke at our [open issues](https://github.com/nusmodifications/nusmods/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

## Getting Started

Install [Node 8+](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) then run the following command:

```sh
$ yarn
```

This will install all of the dependencies you need.

### Development

To run the development build, simply run:

```sh
$ yarn start
```

This will start webpack dev server, which will automatically rebuild and reload any code and components that you have changed. If your editor or IDE has built in support for Flow/ESLint/StyleLint, you can disable them to speed up the build process.

```sh
$ DISABLE_ESLINT=1 DISABLE_FLOW=1 DISABLE_STYLELINT=1 yarn start
```

We recommend the following development tools to help speed up your work

* React Developer Tools ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/react-devtools/))
* [Redux DevTools](http://extension.remotedev.io/#installation)
* [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/)

### Writing styles

We uses [CSS Modules][css-modules] to structure styles. This means that with the exception of a few global styles, styles for each component lives beside their source files (see [colocation](#colocation)). This allows us to write short, semantic names for styles without worrying about collision.

``` scss
// MyComponent.scss
import "~styles/utils/modules-entry"; // Import variables, mixins

.myComponent {
  // .col will be included in the class name whenever .myComponent is used
  composes: col from global;
  color: theme-color();

  :global(.btn) {
    // Selects all child .btn elements
  }

  :global {
    // :global is required for animation since animations are defined globally
    animation: fadeIn 0.3s;
  }
}
```

``` js
// MyComponent.jsx
import styles from './MyComponent.scss';

// To use styles from MyComponent.scss:
<div className={styles.myComponent}>
```

Note that specificity still matters. This is important if you are trying to override Bootstrap styles.

#### SCSS variables vs. CSS custom properties

Both SCSS and CSS variables (aka. custom properties) are used. In most cases, **prefer SCSS variables** as they can be used with SCSS mixins and functions, and integrate with Bootstrap. CSS variable generates more code (since we need to include a fallback for browsers that don't support it), and doesn't play well with SCSS.

Currently CSS variables are used only for colors that change under night mode.

### Fetching data

We use Redux actions to make REST requests. This allows us to store request status in the Redux store, making it available to any component that needs it, and also allows the Redux store to cache the results from requests to make it offline if necessary. Broadly, our strategy corresponds to

#### Writing request actions

To write an action that makes a request, simple call and return the result from `requestAction(key: string, type?: string, options: AxiosXHRConfig)`.

- `type` should describe what the action is fetching, eg. `FETCH_MODULE`. By convention these actions should start with `FETCH_`.
- `key` should be unique for each endpoint the action calls. If the action will only call one endpoint then key can be omitted, and type will be used automatically. For example, fetch module calls a different endpoint for each module, so the key used is `FETCH_MODULE_[Module Code]`.
- `options` is passed directly to `axios()`, so [see its documentation][axios-config] for the full list of configs. Minimally `url` should be specified.

**Example**

```js
import { requestAction } from 'actions/requests';

export const FETCH_DATA = 'FETCH_DATA';
export function fetchData() {
  return requestAction(FETCH_DATA, {
    url: 'http://example.com/api/my-data'
  });
}
```

#### Calling actions from components

Components should dispatch the action to fetch data. The dispatch function returns a Promise of the request response which the component can consume.

**Example**

```js
import { fetchData } from 'actions/example';

type Props = {
  fetchData: () => Promise<MyData>,
}

type State = {
  data: ?MyData,
  error?: any,
}

class MyComponent extends Component<Props> {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.props.fetchData()
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }))
      .catch(error => this.setState({ error });
  }

  render() {
    const { data, error } = this.state;

    if (error) {
      return <ErrorPage />;
    }

    if (!data) {
      return <LoadingSpinner />;
    }

    // Render something with the data
  }
}

export default connect(null, { fetchData })(MyComponent);
```

#### Caching data

To make the data available offline, the data must be stored in the Redux store which is then persisted. To do this create a reducer which listens to `[request type] + SUCCESS`. The payload of the action is the result of the API call. Then in the component, instead of using the result from the Promise directly, we pull the data from the Redux store instead.

This is the [cache-then-network strategy described in the Offline Cookbook][offline-cookbook] and is similar to Workbox's revalidate-while-stale strategy.

**Note:** This assumes the result from the API will not be significantly different after it is loaded. If this is not the case, you might want to use another strategy, otherwise the user may be surprised by the content of the page changing while they're reading it, as the page first renders with stale data, then rerenders with fresh data from the server.

**Reducer example**

```js
import { SUCCESS } from 'types/reducers';
import { FETCH_DATA } from 'actions/example';

export function exampleBank(state: ExampleBank, action: FSA): ExampleBank {
  switch(action.type) {
    case FETCH_DATA + SUCCESS:
      return action.payload;

    // Other actions...
  }

  return state;
}
```

**Component example**

```js
type Props = {
  myData: ?MyData,
  fetchData: () => Promise<MyData>,
}

type State = {
  error?: any,
}

class MyComponent extends Component<Props> {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.props.fetchData()
      .catch(error => this.setState({ error });
  }

  render() {
    const { data, error } = this.state;

    // ErrorPage is only show if there is no cached data available
    // and the request failed
    if (error && !data) {
      return <ErrorPage />;
    }

    if (!data) {
      return <LoadingSpinner />;
    }

    // Render something with the data
  }
}

export default connect(state => ({
  myData: state.exampleBank,
}), { fetchData })(MyComponent);
```

#### Getting request status

If you need to access the status of a request from outside the component which initiated the request, you can use the `isSuccess` and `isFailure` selectors to get the status of any request given its key.

### Adding dependencies

NUSMods tries to be as lean as possible. Adding external dependencies should be done with care to avoid bloating our bundle. Use [Bundlephobia][bundlephobia] to ensure the new dependency is reasonably sized.

#### Flow libdef

When adding a JavaScript package, Flow requires a library definition, or libdef. To try to install one from the [community repository][flow-typed], use the `flow-typed` command. If a community libdef is not available, the same command can also be used to create a stub libdef which you can use immediately in a pinch, or edit to fill in the correct definitions.

```sh
# Use ./node_modules/.bin/flow-typed if you don't want to use npx
npx flow-typed install my-dep@1.0

# Use create-stub for packages without community libdef
npx flow-typed create-stub my-dep
```

### Testing and Linting

We use [Jest][jest] with [Enzyme][enzyme] to test our code and React components, [Flow][flow] for typechecking, [Stylelint][stylelint] and [ESLint][eslint] using [Airbnb config][eslint-airbnb] and [Prettier][prettier] for linting and formatting.

```sh
# Run all tests once with code coverage
$ yarn test

# Writing tests with watch
$ yarn test:watch

# Lint all JS and CSS
$ yarn lint

# Linting CSS, JS source, and run typechecking separately
$ yarn lint:styles
$ yarn lint:code
# Append `--fix` to fix lint errors automatically
# e.g. yarn lint:code --fix
# p.s. Use yarn lint:styles --fix with care (it's experimental),
#      remember to reset changes for themes.scss.

# Run Flow type checking
$ yarn flow
```

#### End to End testing

We currently have some simple E2E tests set up courtesy of Browserstack using Nightwatch. The purpose of this is mainly to catch major regression in browsers at the older end of our browser support matrix (Safari 9, Edge, Firefox ESR) which can be difficult to test manually.

By default the tests are ran against http://staging.nusmods.com, although they can be configured to run against any host, including localhost if you use [Browserstack's local testing feature](https://www.browserstack.com/local-testing#command-line).

```sh
# All commands must include BROWSERSTACK_USER and BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY env variables
# these are omitted for brevity

# Run end to end test against staging
yarn e2e

# Run against deploy preview
LAUNCH_URL="https://deploy-preview-1024--nusmods.netlify.com" yarn e2e

# Enable local testing
./BrowserStackLocal --key $BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY
LAUNCH_URL="http://localhost:8080" LOCAL_TEST=1 yarn e2e
```

### Deployment

Our staging is served from the `./dist` directory, which is generated using `yarn build`. From there, it can be promoted to production using `yarn promote-staging`. This flow is summarized below:

```sh
$ yarn                  # Install dependencies
$ yarn test             # Ensure all unit tests pass
$ yarn build            # Build to staging ./dist directory
# Open http://staging.nusmods.com and manually test to ensure it works
$ yarn promote-staging  # Promote ./dist to production
```

* `yarn build` packages and optimizes the app for deployment. The files will be placed in the `./dist` directory.
* `yarn promote-staging` deploys `./dist` to the production folder, currently `../../beta.nusmods.com`. It is designed to be safe, executing a dry run and asking for confirmation before deployment.
* `yarn rsync <dest-dir>` syncs `./dist` to the specified destination folder `<dest-dir>`. It is mainly used by `yarn promote-staging` but could be used to sync `./dist` to any folder.

### Colocation

Components should keep their styles and tests in the same directory with the same name. For instance, if you have a component called `MyComponent`, the files should look like

```
├── MyComponent.jsx         - Defines the component MyComponent
├── MyComponent.test.jsx    - Tests for MyComponent
└── MyComponent.scss        - Styles for MyComponent

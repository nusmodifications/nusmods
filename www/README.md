## Contributing

Don't know where to start? First, read our repository [contribution guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md). Next, we highly recommend reading [this fantastic beginner's guide][zames-guide] written by one of our contributors. Alternatively, have a poke at our [open issues](https://github.com/nusmodifications/nusmods/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

## Getting Started

Install [Node 8+](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) then run the following command:

```sh
$ yarn
```

This will install all of the dependencies you need.

### Development

To run the development build, simply run:

```sh
$ yarn start
```

This will start webpack dev server, which will automatically rebuild and reload any code and components that you have changed. We recommend the following development tools to help speed up your work

* React Developer Tools ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/react-devtools/))
* [Redux DevTools](http://extension.remotedev.io/#installation)
* [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/)

### Writing styles

We uses [CSS Modules][css-modules] to structure styles. This means that with the exception of a few global styles, styles for each component lives beside their source files (see [colocation](#colocation)). This allows us to write short, semantic names for styles without worrying about collision.

```
// MyComponent.scss
import "~styles/utils/modules-entry"; // Import variables, mixins

.myComponent {
  // .col will be included in the class name whenever .myComponent is used
  composes: col from global;
  color: theme-color();

  :global(.btn) {
    // Selects all child .btn elements
  }

  :global {
    // :global is required for animation since animations are defined globally
    animation: fadeIn 0.3s;
  }
}

// MyComponent.jsx
import styles from './MyComponent.scss';

// To use styles from MyComponent.scss:
<div className={styles.myComponent}>
```

Note that specificity still matters. This is important if you are trying to override Bootstrap styles.

#### SCSS variables vs. CSS custom properties

Both SCSS and CSS variables (aka. custom properties) are used. In most cases, **prefer SCSS variables** as they can be used with SCSS mixins and functions, and integrate with Bootstrap. CSS variable generates more code (since we need to include a fallback for browsers that don't support it), and doesn't play well with SCSS.

Currently CSS variables are used only for colors that change under night mode.

### Testing and Linting

We use [Jest][jest] with [Enzyme][enzyme] to test our code and React components, [Flow][flow] for typechecking, [Stylelint][stylelint] and [ESLint][eslint] using [Airbnb config][eslint-airbnb] and [Prettier][prettier] for linting and formatting.

```sh
# Run all tests once with code coverage
$ yarn test

# Writing tests with watch
$ yarn test:watch

# Lint all JS and CSS
$ yarn lint

# Linting CSS, JS source, tests and scripts separately
$ yarn lint:styles
$ yarn lint:src
$ yarn lint:test
$ yarn lint:scripts
# Append `--fix` to fix lint errors automatically
# e.g. yarn lint:src --fix
# p.s. Use yarn lint:styles --fix with care (it's experimental),
#      remember to reset changes for themes.scss.

# Run Flow type checking
$ yarn flow
```

### Deployment

Our staging is served from the `./dist` directory, which is generated using `yarn build`. From there, it can be promoted to production using `yarn promote-staging`. This flow is summarized below:

```sh
$ yarn # Install dependencies
$ yarn test # Ensure all unit tests pass
$ yarn build # Build to staging ./dist directory
# Manually ensure staging build works.
$ yarn promote-staging # Promote ./dist to production
```

* `yarn build` packages and optimizes the app for deployment. The files will be placed in the `./dist` directory.
* `yarn promote-staging` deploys `./dist` to the production folder, currently `../../beta.nusmods.com`. It is designed to be safe, executing a dry run and asking for confirmation before deployment.
* `yarn rsync <dest-dir>` syncs `./dist` to the specified destination folder `<dest-dir>`. It is mainly used by `yarn promote-staging` but could be used to sync `./dist` to any folder.

└── webpack                  - webpack config
```

### Colocation

Components should keep their styles and tests in the same directory with the same name. For instance, if you have a component called `MyComponent`, the files should look like

```
├── MyComponent.jsx         - Defines the component MyComponent
├── MyComponent.test.jsx    - Tests for MyComponent
└── MyComponent.scss        - Styles for MyComponent

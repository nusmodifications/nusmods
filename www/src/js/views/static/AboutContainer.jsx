      <h3>A Brief History</h3>
      <p>
        NUSModifications (NUSMods) was founded in 2012 by{' '}
        <ExternalLink href="http://benghee.eu/">Beng</ExternalLink> to provide a better way for
        students to plan their school timetables. Over time, more features have been added to
        improve the lives of NUS students. Besides timetable planning, NUSMods also serves as a
        complete knowledge bank of NUS modules by providing useful module-related information such
        as archived CORS bidding statistics and community-driven module reviews and discussions.
      </p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>
        In the long term, NUSMods strives to enhance the quality of students&apos; lives in school
        by serving as a one-stop platform that provides both useful tools and an avenue for students
        to share their knowledge and experiences.
      </p>

      <p>
        As an app built by students for students, NUSMods hopes to encourage fellow students to
        experiment and create original, community-engaging work that also improves the lives of NUS
        students. Examples of such initiatives are Corspedia, which has been integrated into NUSMods
        as of July 2014, and Modify.sg, which was merged with NUSMods as of December 2017.
      </p>

      <h3>Future</h3>
      <p>
        NUSMods is a fast-evolving project, and there are many things to be done. Help us help you!

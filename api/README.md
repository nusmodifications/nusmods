# NUSMods API Servers

The NUSMods API is comprised of backend server projects that support our
NUSMods website.

Currently, the NUSMods API consists of one server. More information can be
found within its folder:

1. [Data server](data) - Contains documentation for our REST API and the
   implementation of our new GraphQL data server.

We'd be happy to deploy any additional tasks to the live API site as well.

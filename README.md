We are a passionate team of students and alumni dedicated to enhancing school life through technology. With NUSMods, we assist over 30,000 students every semester in planning their timetables and finding the best modules to take.

## Usage

For users, you can access our website at [nusmods.com](https://nusmods.com). There's no mobile app, but our website is mobile-friendly and can be pinned to your home screen on Android and iOS.

If you need to access NUSMods data programmatically, we provide a [public API](https://api.nusmods.com/v2/) for you to retrieve the necessary information. Additionally, if you wish to export your timetables, we offer  [timetable export service](https://export.nusmods.com/) that you can use. Please be considerate and use these services responsibly.

## Contributing

We welcome contributors of all skill levels and backgrounds. Our [contribute page](https://nusmods.com/contribute) goes over the various ways you can contribute to NUSMods for general users.

For developers and designers, our [contributing guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md) will help first-time contributors get started. For more advanced topics, we have an [architecture overview](/ARCHITECTURE.md) that explains how the various projects in this repository fit together.

Quite a few of our contributors are students who started contributing to NUSMods with no prior experience. They have since gone on to internships and full-time jobs as software engineers / designers / founders. We are happy to help you get started and learn new skills!

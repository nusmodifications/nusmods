# NUSMods Maintenance Notes

Create a new issue on GitHub with this checklist after the finals every semester.

## Every Year

- [ ] Update academic year and semester in `website/src/config/app-config.json`, and add current academic year to archive years
- [ ] In `app-config.json`, update `examAvailability` to include only the semesters where exam information is available
- [ ] Update with next year's holiday data from https://github.com/rjchow/singapore_public_holidays and delete old data, then run `scripts/holidays-csv-to-json.js`
- [ ] Update `website/src/data/academic-calendar.json` with data for the new academic year
- [ ] Add announcement to website
- [ ] Update academic year in `scrapers/nus-v2/src/config.ts`
- [ ] Ensure that scraper is scraping next AY's data. You can do so by checking the locally published JSON files, or visiting `https://api.nusmods.com/v2/20XX-20XX/` (e.g. [https://api.nusmods.com/v2/2022-2023/](https://api.nusmods.com/v2/2022-2023/))
- [ ] On Vercel or `.env`: Update academic year in export service's environment variables
- [ ] Deploy! :tada: :tada:
- [ ] Monitor Sentry and Messenger for issues

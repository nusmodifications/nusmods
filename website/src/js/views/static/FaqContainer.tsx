      <div className={styles.question} id="mistakes">
        <h5>There is a mistake! Can you update your system?</h5>
        <p>This question applies to these situations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>There is a missing lecture or tutorial slot.</li>
          <li>The exam date is wrong.</li>
          <li>You cannot find a module.</li>
          <li>Semester X data is not available.</li>
          <li>
            You cannot add a module in semester X but your faculty says it is available in that
            semester.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please ensure the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>You are sure that the module should exist or that the data on NUSMods is wrong.</li>
          <li>You have waited one day and the error is still present.</li>
          <li>You have refreshed NUSMods after step 2.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          If you have done all the above and the error is still present, please write to us at{' '}
          <ExternalLink href="mailto:modules@nusmods.com">modules@nusmods.com</ExternalLink>. We
          will work with the Registrar&apos;s Office to rectify any errors. Once the data becomes
          available, NUSMods will reflect it within a day.

        <p>
          Unfortunately, the macOS Calendar app has a bug which we cannot work around. Our ICS file
          is correct, but Calendar refuses to import it correctly. You can try using another
          calendar app like{' '}
          <ExternalLink href="https://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</ExternalLink> or{' '}
          <ExternalLink href="https://outlook.com">Outlook.com</ExternalLink>. If you want an app,
          here&apos;s{' '}
          <ExternalLink href="https://zapier.com/blog/best-calendar-apps/">
            a list of 18 apps for macOS
          </ExternalLink>
          .
        </p>

        <p>
          You can also link your NUSNet email account with the macOS Mail app, which gives you the
          option to sync your school timetable automatically.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have also found that the bug only occurs some of the time, so if you really want to,
          you can try removing and adding back the calendar until it works (no, we don&apos;t know
          why this works either).

      <div className={styles.question} id="about">
        <h5>NUSMods is cool, where do you guys come from?</h5>
        <p>
          NUSMods is a student-run initiative born out of the frustration of a lack of usable NUS
          timetable planners (
          <ExternalLink href="https://webrb.nus.edu.sg/ctt/builder.aspx">
            the official one
          </ExternalLink>{' '}
          provides a delightful hair-pulling experience &ndash; go ahead, try it out). Since most of
          us come from the School of Computing, we decided to put our technical skills to use,
          creating something that will make your lives easier and better.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting in AY18/19 Special Term I, NUSMods will become the university&apos;s official
          timetable planner. However, apart from that, we are unaffiliated with NUS. NUSMods
          certainly does not make decisions regarding your curriculum, module availability and
          module timetable. If you have questions regarding your curriculum, module registration,
          LumiNUS, or anything unrelated to NUSMods, please either contact your faculty or just{' '}
          <ExternalLink href="https://www.google.com/">Google</ExternalLink> it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className={styles.question} id="export">
        <h5>Is it possible to export my timetable to Excel?</h5>
        <p>
          No, and we have no plans to make this possible. Having said that, if you would like to
          implement this, we welcome pull requests{' '}
          <ExternalLink href={config.contact.githubRepo}>here</ExternalLink>!

          Please update your browser. Although we recommend the latest version of Google Chrome,
          Firefox, Safari or Edge, we support the latest two versions of these browsers.
          Unfortunately, we cannot support more browsers or older versions due to our limited
          resources. If you are using iOS 10 or below, please update your device to iOS 11 or 12, or
          use another computer to access NUSMods.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are seeing a white page in an up-to-date Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Edge, do
          contact us.

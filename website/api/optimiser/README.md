# NUSMods Timetable Optimiser

An intelligent timetable optimisation service that explores millions of possible timetable combinations to generate optimal schedules for NUS students. Built with Go and deployed as a serverless function on Vercel.

## Features

The optimiser intelligently prioritises:

- **Preferred free days** - Keep entire days free from physical classes
- **Ideal class timings** - Respect earliest and latest class time preferences
- **Lunch flexibility** - Optimise for preferred lunch break timing ranges
- **Minimal travel distance** - Reduce walking distances between consecutive classes using venue coordinates
- **Recording/Non-physical preferences** - Handle online/recorded lessons that don't require physical attendance

### Algorithm

The optimiser uses a **Beam Search algorithm** to efficiently explore the vast search space of possible timetable combinations:

1. **State Space**: Each state represents a partial timetable assignment
2. **Beam Width**: Maintains top N (=100) most promising states at each step (=2500) (configurable)
3. **Branching Factor**: Limits the number of options considered per lesson type (=100) (configurable)
4. **Scoring Function**: Evaluates states based on:
   - Total walking distance between consecutive classes
   - Lunch break timing
   - <= 2 hours max gap between classes (configurable)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Go 1.23.4](https://golang.org/dl/) or later

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nusmodifications/nusmods.git
   cd nusmods/website/api/optimiser
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Update the API in the frontend (change back after testing)**
- In `website/src/apis/optimiser.ts`, change the api from `/api/optimiser/optimise` to `http://localhost:8020/optimise`

4. **Run test server**
   ```bash
   yarn start:optimiser -port 8020
   ```

5. **Test the API**
- Send a POST request following the request body format above to `http://localhost:8020/optimise`


## Dependencies

| Package                                                                  | Purpose                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`github.com/umahmood/haversine`](https://github.com/umahmood/haversine) | Calculate walking distances between venues using GPS coordinates |

## Performance

- **Typical Runtime**: 5-40 seconds depending on complexity
- **Search Space**: Handles millions of possible timetable combinations
- **Memory Efficient**: Uses beam search to limit memory usage while maintaining solution quality

## Limitations

- **Venue Data Dependency**: Optimisation quality depends on accurate venue coordinate data from NUSMods
- **Academic Year Coverage**: Limited to semesters with available NUSMods API data
- **Lesson Type Support**: Optimises for standard NUS lesson types (may not handle special/custom lesson formats)

## Potential Improvements

- Once there is more concrete information on the building location for each venue, we can remove the current method of identifying building by taking the first few letters before the '-' in the venue name. This will improve the accuracy and reduce search space.
- Tweak the scoring function to prioritise more important constraints found from user feedback. For instance:
  - Previously the scoring function was just for distance but it produced less ideal timetables where students had 4-5 hour gaps between classes. This was fixed by punishing gaps that are
  larger than 2 hours between lessons linearly.

- Tweak the beam search parameters to improve performance (perhaps depending on the number of modules)
- Create a more accurate heuristic for scoring distance between consecutive classes. (Currently, it just a random linear function that seems to work)
- Add more constraints to optimisation proceess
- Clean up codebase to make it more maintainable

 *                This is when you should prepare the cache.
 * 2. `activate`: Service worker is ready to take over and waiting.
 *                This is when you should clean up the previous service worker's cache.
 *                Note: The previous service worker will be running until all clients are stopped,
 *                which means that all tabs must be closed. Refreshing will not work.
 *                However, one may call `skipWaiting` to force the previous service worker to stop.
 * 3. `fetch`:    Service worker is running and client is fetching for a resource.
 *                This is when you handle runtime caching and/or offline fallbacks.
 *
 * For other events: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerGlobalScope#Events

 * from the previous service worker's cached JavaScript file.
